## üåê About the Project

### üìñ Description
&emsp;Tap Room

- see a list/menu of all available kegs. 
- For each keg, see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent.
- submit a form to add a new keg to a list.
- able to click on a keg to see its detail page.
- see how many pints are left in a keg. Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints.
- able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0.


Further Exploration

- the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake.
- be able to delete a keg.
- a keg to update to say "Out of Stock" once it's empty.
- kegs with less than 10 pints to include a message that says "Almost Empty" so I can try a pint before it's gone!
- have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability. This could be based on their price, the style of beer or kombucha, or the amount of pints left.
- this application to be nicely styled. (Use stylesheets and CSS objects!)
Objectives

This week's progress will be checked using the following objectives:

- Application compiles and runs and all required functionality is included.
- Functional and class components are used correctly.
- Application effectively uses local and shared state.
- Props are used correctly and always include PropTypes.
- README includes an accurate representation of the application's component tree.
- Project was submitted by the deadline.
- Project demonstrates an understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you can discuss your code with an instructor using the correct terminology.

Once again, make sure to plan your application first and include a component diagram in your README.
